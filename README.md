Technology Stack

Spring Boot: Framework for building microservices.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access with JPA.
Spring Security: Provides authentication and authorization.
Thymeleaf: Templating engine for creating dynamic HTML views.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Relational database for data storage.
JUnit/Mockito: Testing frameworks for unit and integration tests.
Additional Considerations

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and exception handling mechanisms.
Data Validation: Validate user input to ensure data integrity.
Security: Follow best practices for securing the application, including input validation, output encoding, and protecting against common vulnerabilities.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
Deployment: Consider deployment options like deploying to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) or using containerization with Docker and Kubernetes.
